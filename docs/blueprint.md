# **App Name**: AddressData

This blueprint outlines the technical architecture for a Nigerian address verification service with a user submission portal, a manual verification console, and a developer API.

## 1. Project Overview

**AddressData** is an address intelligence platform purpose-built for Nigeria. It provides developers, businesses, and admins with tools to validate, store, and retrieve Nigerian address data in a structured, efficient, and scalable way. The system supports manual overrides, geolocation comparisons, and machine-readable outputs — all designed to boost accuracy and usability in real-world applications.

## 2. Firebase Services Utilized

- **Firebase Authentication:** For managing user accounts (portal users) and administrator accounts (verification console).
- **Firestore:** A NoSQL cloud database to store submitted addresses, verified addresses, geographic data, and API key information.
- **Firebase Storage:** To potentially store any auxiliary files related to address submissions.
- **Firebase Hosting:** To host the user submission portal and the manual verification console web applications.
- **Cloud Functions for Firebase:** To implement the backend logic, including address submissions, Google Maps interactions, API endpoints, API key validation, and manual verification actions.
- **Firebase Security Rules:** To secure data in Firestore.

## 3. Database Structure (Firestore)

- `users`: Stores user profile information, including roles.
  - Document ID: Firebase Auth UID.
  - Fields: `email`, `name`, `role` ('user' or 'admin'), `createdAt`.

- `addressSubmissions`: Stores addresses submitted by users awaiting verification.
  - Document ID: Auto-generated.
  - Fields:
    - `userId`: Firebase Auth UID of the submitter.
    - `userName`: Name of the submitter.
    - `userEmail`: Email of the submitter.
    - `submittedAddress`: Object containing `streetAddress`, `areaDistrict`, `city`, `lga`, `state`, `zipCode` (optional), `country` (default "Nigeria").
    - `propertyType`: Enum ('residential', 'commercial').
    - `googleMapsSuggestion` (optional): Address string from Google Maps.
    - `status`: Enum ('pending_review', 'approved', 'verified', 'rejected'). (Note: 'verified' is used for Estates).
    - `aiFlaggedReason` (optional): Reason if AI flagged a discrepancy.
    - `submittedAt`: Server timestamp.
    - `reviewedAt` (optional): Server timestamp of review.
    - `reviewerId` (optional): Firebase Auth UID of the admin reviewer.
    - `reviewNotes` (optional): Notes from admin review.

- `apiKeys`: Stores API keys issued to developers.
  - Document ID: Auto-generated.
  - Fields:
    - `userId`: Firebase Auth UID of the developer.
    - `userName`: Name of the developer.
    - `userEmail`: Email of the developer.
    - `publicKey`: Generated public key.
    - `privateKeyHash`: Hashed version of the private key.
    - `name` (optional): User-friendly name for the key.
    - `createdAt`: Server timestamp.
    - `lastUsedAt` (optional): Server timestamp of last use.
    - `isActive`: Boolean.

- `nigerianGeography`: Stores hierarchical geographic data.
  - Collection: `nigerianGeography` (Each document is a State)
    - Document ID: State name (e.g., "lagos-state").
    - Fields:
      - `name`: State name (e.g., "Lagos").
      - `capital`: State capital.
    - Subcollection: `lgas` (Each document is an LGA)
      - Document ID: LGA name (e.g., "ikeja-lga").
      - Fields:
        - `name`: LGA name (e.g., "Ikeja").
      - Subcollection: `cities` (Each document is a City/Town)
        - Document ID: City name (e.g., "ikeja-city").
        - Fields:
          - `name`: City name (e.g., "Ikeja").

## 4. Core Features:

### 🔐 **Authentication**

- **Portal Access**: Sign in with Google or GitHub.
- **Console Access**: Access via email/password authentication — limited to `@haqqman.com` work emails only.

---

### 📍 **Address Entry & Verification**

- **User-Submitted Format**: Users can save their address _exactly as it appears physically_ — to handle local naming variations not always captured by Google Maps.
- **AI-Assisted Review**:
  - If the submitted address matches Google Maps (via Genkit flow), it is auto-approved.
  - If not, it is flagged for manual review in the admin console.

---

### ⚙️ **Developer API Access**

- **API Key Pair**:
  - Developers get a **Public Key** and a **Private Key**.
  - Keys enable controlled access to various endpoints (rate-limited).
- **Endpoints** (Implemented via Cloud Functions or Next.js API Routes if not using Cloud Functions directly for this):
  - `/api/autocomplete`: Suggest addresses from verified Nigerian addresses.
  - `/api/states`: List all Nigerian states, each with their respective LGAs and cities.
  - `/api/states/{stateId}/lgas`: List LGAs for a state.
  - `/api/states/{stateId}/lgas/{lgaId}/cities`: List cities for an LGA.

---

### 🧠 **Smart Address Autocomplete**

- Show users a dropdown of **verified** Nigerian addresses during:
  - Checkout flows
  - Registration forms
  - Delivery portals
- Benefits:
  - Faster address entry
  - Increased conversion rates
  - Reduced delivery errors

---

### 💾 **Structured Address Storage**

- All addresses are stored in structured fields for compatibility:
  - Street Address
  - Area/District
  - City
  - LGA
  - State
  - Zip Code (if applicable)
  - Country
- Developers are **strongly encouraged** to replicate this structure in their own systems to maximize compatibility with AddressData APIs.

---

## 5. Console Capabilities:

- Manually review unverified addresses flagged by the system.
- Approve or reject based on internal rules or map comparison.
- View and manage all user submissions.
- Create and manage developer API keys.
- Manage geographic data (States, LGAs, Cities).

---

## 6. Style Guidelines:

- **Primary Color**: Dark Blue (#0C213A) — professionalism and trust.
- **Secondary Color**: Green (#79C142) — growth, verification, positivity.
- **Accent Color (Buttons, CTAs)**: Yellow/Gold (#FFCC33) — attention-grabbing for actions.
- **Atlantis Green (for gradients with Secondary, if needed)**: #9CCC48
- **Typography**: Use modern, legible fonts (e.g. Lato, DM Sans, or Inter). Currently Lato.
- **Icons**: Use standard, clear icons (Lucide React) for address types, navigation, and validation cues.

---

## 7. Genkit AI Integration

- `flagAddressDiscrepancies` flow: Used to compare user-submitted addresses with Google Maps data to determine if manual review is needed.
  - Input: User's address string, Google Maps API derived address string.
  - Output: Boolean `isDiscrepant`, String `reason`.

---

## 8. Considerations

- **Google Maps API Costs:** Monitor usage for geocoding/places lookups.
- **Data Accuracy:** Manual review quality is key.
- **Scalability:** Firebase services are scalable. Optimize Firestore queries and Function performance.
- **Error Handling & Logging:** Implement robust error handling and logging.
- **Security:** Secure Firebase console access. API Keys should be handled securely.
